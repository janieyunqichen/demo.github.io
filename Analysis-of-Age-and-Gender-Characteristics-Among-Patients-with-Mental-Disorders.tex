\chapter{About this report}\label{about-this-report}}

This report is about the prevalence of mental disorders, breaking it
down by age and gender characteristics. It analyses the characteristics
of mental disorder patients and different service recipients. Data for
this report have been sourced from the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS), the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), and the
Report on Government Services (RoGS).

In this report, the abbreviation ``MD'' is used to denote ``mental
disorder.''

\hypertarget{definitions}{%
\chapter{Definitions}\label{definitions}}

\emph{Note: The phrases marked with an asterisk are explained in the
Definition section.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Mental illness}: a clinically diagnosable disorder that
  significantly interferes with an individual's cognitive, emotional or
  social abilities. It covers a range of illnesses including anxiety,
  affective and substance use disorders.
\item
  \textbf{Any 12-month mental disorder}: persons who met criteria for
  diagnosis of a lifetime mental disorder (with hierarchy) and had
  sufficient symptoms of that disorder in the previous 12 months. A
  person may have more than one 12-month mental disorder.
\item
  \textbf{Lifetime mental disorders}: the number of people who met the
  diagnostic criteria for having a mental disorder at some time in their
  life. This does not imply that a person has had a mental disorder
  throughout their entire life.
\item
  \textbf{Community mental health care (CMHC)}: Community mental health
  care refers to government‑funded and operated specialised mental
  health care provided by community mental health care services and
  hospital‑based ambulatory care services, such as outpatient and day
  clinics.
\item
  \textbf{CMHC service contacts}: CMHC service contacts can be conducted
  as either individual or group sessions. Service contacts can also be
  face-to-face, via telephone, or using other forms of direct
  communication such as video link. They can be conducted in the
  presence of the patient, with a third party (such as a carer or family
  member) and/or other professional or mental health worker.
\item
  \textbf{Specialist homelessness service(s) (SHS):} Specialist
  homelessness service(s) is assistance provided by a specialist
  homelessness agency to a client aimed at responding to or preventing
  homelessness. The specialist homelessness services in scope for this
  collection include accommodation provision, assistance to sustain
  housing, mental health services, family/relationship assistance,
  disability services, drug/alcohol counselling, legal/financial
  services, immigration/cultural services, domestic/family violence
  services, other specialist services and general assistance and
  support.
\item
  \textbf{Residential mental health care (RMHC)}: Residential mental
  health care refers to residential care provided by residential mental
  health services. A residential mental health service is a specialised
  mental health service that:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    employs mental health trained staff on‑site
  \item
    provides rehabilitation, treatment or extended care to residents for
    whom the care is intended to be on an overnight basis and in a
    domestic‑like environment
  \item
    encourages the residents to take responsibility for their daily
    living activities.
  \end{itemize}

  These services include those that employ mental health trained staff
  on-site 24 hours per day and other services with less intensive
  staffing. However, all these services employ on‑site mental health
  trained staff for some part of the day.
\item
  \textbf{Episodes of residential care:} Episodes of residential care
  are defined as a period of care between the start of residential care
  (either through the formal start of the residential stay or the start
  of a new reference period (that is, 1 July)) and the end of
  residential care (either through the formal end of residential care,
  commencement of leave intended to be greater than 7 days, or the end
  of the reference period (that is, 30 June)). An individual can have
  one or more episodes of care during the reference period.
\item
  \textbf{Psychosocial disability:} Psychosocial disability describes a
  disability that comes from a mental health condition. Not everyone who
  has a mental health condition will have a psychosocial disability.
  Examples of some psychosocial disabilities include Schizophrenia and
  Schizoaffective disorder, Anxiety disorders, Obsessive compulsive
  disorder, Post-traumatic stress disorder, Agoraphobia and Social
  phobia or Mood disorders, such as Depression and Bipolar.
\item
  \textbf{Primary disability}: A primary disabilityis~the disability
  that causes the most difficulties in everyday life. Many people have
  multiple disabilities or other comorbid conditions that do not impair
  the person to the same extent as their primary disability. These are
  referred to as secondary disabilities.

\section{About the data}\label{about-the-data}}

The 2020-21 National Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing (NSMHW)
measures the prevalence of mental disorders among Australians aged 16-85
years using the World Health Organization Composite International
Diagnostic Interview.

Respondents were asked about their experiences and symptoms of mental
ill-health throughout their lifetime, from which two key measures are
analysed:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{lifetime mental disorders}, which refers to the number of
  people who met the diagnostic criteria for having a mental disorder at
  some time in their life. This does not imply that a person has had a
  mental disorder throughout their entire life
\item
  \textbf{12-month mental disorders}, which refers to the number of
  people who met the diagnostic criteria for having a mental disorder at
  some time in their life and had sufficient symptoms of that disorder
  in the 12 months prior to the survey.
\end{itemize}

Three groups of mental disorders are assessed---Anxiety, Affective and
Substance Use disorders---based on definitions and criteria of the World
Health Organization International Classification of Diseases, Tenth
Revision.

The data used for this section came from two sources:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  \href{https://www.pc.gov.au/ongoing/report-on-government-services/2023/health/services-for-mental-health}{Report

  Study of Mental Health and Wellbeing}
\end{enumerate}

\emph{Note: Due to COVID-related difficulties with in-person data
collection during 2021, the National Study of Mental Health and
Wellbeing (NSMHW) was conducted in two parts from 2020 to 2022. As a
result, only national totals are available for reporting in 2023. These
data \textbf{should not be compared to the 2007 survey} due to a smaller
sample size in 2020-2021. (State and territory data are expected to be
available for the 2024 Report.)}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  In both 2007 and 2020-21, a higher proportion of females reported
  experiencing symptoms of mental disorders in the 12 months leading up
  to the survey. In contrast, a more significant percentage of males
  reported lifetime mental disorders but did not exhibit symptoms in the
  12 months prior to the survey.
\item
  In 2020-21, nearly 40\% of individuals aged 16-24 reported
  experiencing mental disorders in the 12 months prior to the survey.
  This prevalence declined with increasing age.
\item
  For those aged 25-74, between 20\% and 30\% reported having lifetime
  mental disorders without symptoms in the past 12 months. For the age
  groups 16-24 and 75-85, the figures stood at approximately 10\% and
  15\%, respectively.

Patient characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The age distribution of patients exhibits a bell-shaped, right-skewed
  curve, with the peak in the 25-34 age group.
\item
  Significantly higher percentages and numbers of patients are aged
  12-17 in NSW, Qld, WA, SA, and Tas.
\item
  Except in NT, female patients outnumber male patients across all
  states. The highest numbers of female patients are found in NSW and
  WA, and the percentage of female patients is especially high in WA,
  Tas, and ACT.

\section{CMHC Contacts}\label{cmhc-contacts}}

CMHC service contacts can be conducted as either individual or group
sessions. Service contacts can also be face-to-face, via telephone, or
using other forms of direct communication such as video link. They can
be conducted in the presence of the patient, with a third party (such as
a carer or family member) and/or other professional or mental health
worker.

\section{About the Data}\label{about-the-data-2}}

This section is about the clients who identified as having a current
mental health issue and received specialist homelessness services (SHS).

\textbf{Specialist homelessness service(s) (SHS)} is assistance provided
by a specialist homelessness agency to a client aimed at responding to
or preventing homelessness. The specialist homelessness services in
scope for this collection include accommodation provision, assistance to
sustain housing, mental health services, family/relationship assistance,
disability services, drug/alcohol counselling, legal/financial services,
immigration/cultural services, domestic/family violence services, other
specialist services and general assistance and support.
